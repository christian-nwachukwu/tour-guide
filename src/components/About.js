            clarity and peace of mind for immigrants 
            outside of Canada, who have been nominated 
            or received endorsement by Nova Scotia (PNP).

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>
            We provide support and information 
            to ensure you arrived prepared. 
            We do this through one-on-one 
            consultations to understand your 
            unique needs and settlement goals. 
            After this consultation, a pre-arrival 
            plan is created to identify the services 
            and programs you can take to support your journey. 
            </p>

            <h1>Our Vision</h1>
            <p>
            We support you with information 
            and personalized guidance to provide 
            you with valuable resources to support 
            your settlement journey. We do this 
            through providing comprehensive settlement 
            resources for obtaining things such as 
            health cards and banking information. 
            We orientate you to life in Canada and 
            specifically Nova Scotia, your new home.
